        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want the visitor to feel welcomed and engaged with the overall narrative of the book. 
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want the viewer to feel safe and capable to navigate and use the site to the fullest capacity. I want them to feel compelled and motivated to participate and buy the initial product(The Book). I want them to have answers for their pressing questions and feel confident with their purchase,feeling attached to the brand and identity of Samuel.

        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want the customers to feel a sense of engagement and a hardy welcome back home. 
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want them to feel valued and understood about their past and present feelings.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The main colors used are white(elegance), grey (deep and trusted), blue(safety and enjoyable,) and red (urgency and importance).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Azo Sans was found on Adobe and was one of the main fonts throughout the website. Sans Serif was the fallback font in case for any other reason the font wasn't being displayed. Azo Sans is a clean and modern look for the site and gives it a fun but elegant vibe.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is one of my favorite parts. The first main image gives a mountain top experiance, showing how the viewer should feel after reading the book. I wanted to position the customer as the hero and show their victory first and formost.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...

- Visual studio was used instead of Git Pod because of issues that it was having. This is why the code was commited in a different timeline. My mentor said I needed to make you aware that I was not aware of how to use VS and Git pod connectivity for commit history.
